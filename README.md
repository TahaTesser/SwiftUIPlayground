# Swift Playground

> [!NOTE]
> This is a collection of Swift/SwiftUI samples. It includes code snippets, examples, and exercises that I have collected from various sources and created myself.
> I have created this repository to help me learn Swift and SwiftUI. I hope it will be useful to others as well.
